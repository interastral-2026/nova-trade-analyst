      "analysis": "Price is currently testing a support zone at 71.60 after a minor liquidity sweep. A bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG) is identified on the lower timeframe near 71.58. The trade targets a breakout above the recent 71.74 resistance to reach the next liquidity pool at 72.85. The TP is set to ensure a net profit after accounting for the 0.6% round-trip exchange fees (approx 0.43 EUR). SL is placed strictly below the recent swing low to manage risk aggressively.",
